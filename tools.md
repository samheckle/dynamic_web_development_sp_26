# Required Course Tools

1. A text editor
   - I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), which is an open source lightweight fork of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you are welcome to use whatever is most comfortable.
   - I would encourage disabling any autocomplete tools (the text editor autocomplete, linting, or AI tools) as they may be disruptive while following along with class demos.
   - Suggested extensions: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), HTML CSS Intellisense, EJS Language Support
2. Sign up for a [Github account](https://github.com/)
   - Suggested sign up for [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
3. Sign up for a DigitalOcean account
   - You can receive $200 free credits from the Github Student Developer Pack
   - If that doesn't work, or you already used it, you can use my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/c57ec6b3cb5f).
   - If you do not use either, you should expect $4 / month of this class (~$8 total). This does not include any optional domain purchasing.
4. Install an FTP service.
   - I use [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)
5. Command Line Tools
   - Windows: Install [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - Mac: Terminal is pre-installed, but you need to enable [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) by opening Terminal and running `xcode-select --install`
   - Linux: See [git docs](https://git-scm.com/install/linux) based on your distribution.
6. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
